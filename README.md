# Dashboard Panel for H.O.R.N.E.T Storage Nostr Relay

This repository is home to the hornet storage panal which is a typescript / react web application designed for managing a hornet storage nostr multimedia relay which can be found here: https://github.com/HORNET-Storage/HORNETS-Nostr-Relay

### Live Demo
We have a live demo that can be found at http://hornetstorage.net for anyone that wants to see what the panel looks like.

## Key Features
- Manage your hornet-storage relay config directly from the panel
- Switch between our new dumb and smart model for accepting nostr notes
- Decide from which of the supported nostr kinds to enable
- Choose which supported transport protocols to enable such as libp2p and websockets
- Enable / disable which media extensions are accepted by the relay such as png and mp4
- View statistics about stored notes and media
